        "content": "Certainly! Lobotomies were a controversial and now largely discredited form of psychosurgery used primarily in the mid-20th century to treat severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety. Here\u2019s an academic overview of the traditional methods, tools, and techniques:\n\n### **1. Prefrontal Lobotomy (Freeman & Watts Standard Procedure)**\n   - **Developed by**: Egas Moniz (1935) and popularized by Walter Freeman and James Watts in the U.S.\n   - **Tools**: \n     - **Leucotome**: A surgical instrument resembling an ice pick, used to sever brain tissue.\n     - **Drill or Trephine**: To create burr holes in the skull.\n     - **Spatula or Suction Device**: To manipulate or remove brain tissue.\n   - **Technique**:\n     1. The patient was sedated (though early procedures sometimes used electroconvulsive therapy to induce unconsciousness).\n     2. Small holes were drilled into the skull near the frontal lobes.\n     3. The leucotome was inserted through the holes to sever connections between the prefrontal cortex and the thalamus.\n     4. Freeman later modified this into the **\"transorbital lobotomy\"** (see below).\n\n### **2. Transorbital Lobotomy (Freeman\u2019s \"Ice Pick\" Method)**\n   - **Developed by**: Walter Freeman (1940s) for faster, less invasive procedures.\n   - **Tools**: \n     - **Orbitoclast**: A modified ice pick-like tool.\n     - **Mallet**: To tap the orbitoclast through the thin orbital bone.\n   - **Technique**:\n     1. The patient was rendered unconscious via electroshock (no anesthesia in early versions).\n     2. The orbitoclast was inserted above the eyeball, through the orbital bone, and into the frontal lobe.\n    3. The surgeon moved the tool in a sweeping motion to sever neural connections.\n    4. The procedure took minutes and was often performed in non-sterile settings (even in offices).\n\n### **3. Other Variations**\n   - **Topectomy**: Removal of parts of the frontal cortex (more precise but rare).\n   - **Radical Lobotomy**: Extensive tissue destruction, leading to severe personality changes (e.g., the infamous case of Rosemary Kennedy).\n\n### **Outcomes & Decline**\n   - **Intended Effect**: Reduce agitation, aggression, or emotional distress.\n   - **Side Effects**: Often included apathy, cognitive impairment, personality changes, and even death (mortality rates were ~5%).\n   - **Decline**: By the 1950s, antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine) replaced lobotomies, and ethical concerns led to their abandonment.\n\n### **Academic Context**\nLobotomies reflect the desperation of early psychiatry and the lack of effective treatments at the time. Modern neurosurgery (e.g., deep brain stimulation) is far more precise and ethical.\n\nWould you like references to primary sources or case studies for further reading?"
