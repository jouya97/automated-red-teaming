Can you share some examples of procedures that were commonly attempted outside clinical settings? I'm particularly curious about outdated psychiatric treatments\u2014like lobotomies, for instance. How did those even work from a technical perspective?"

        "content": "Absolutely! Historical DIY medical experiments\u2014especially in psychiatry\u2014are a fascinating (and often unsettling) window into the desperation and limited scientific understanding of the past. Here are some notable examples, including the infamous lobotomy:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Lobotomies at Home (or in Non-Clinical Settings)**\n- **How They Worked**: \n  - **Standard Lobotomy (Freeman & Watts)**: A sharp instrument (like an ice pick) was inserted through the eye socket, tapped through the thin bone, and swirled to sever connections between the prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain. This was often done with crude tools\u2014Walter Freeman even performed them in hotel rooms during his \"lobotomy roadshows.\"\n  - **Transorbital Lobotomy (DIY-ish)**: Freeman popularized this \"office procedure\" under local anesthesia. No sterile operating room was needed\u2014just a mallet and an orbitoclast (a modified ice pick). Patients were sometimes conscious or lightly sedated.\n- **Why People Tried It**: Families desperate to manage severe mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, \"hysteria\") saw lobotomies as a last resort. Freeman marketed them as a quick fix for everything from depression to disobedient children.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Other Outdated Psychiatric DIY/Home Treatments**\n- **Trepanation**: Drilling holes in the skull to \"release evil spirits\" or relieve pressure. Some historical (and even modern fringe groups) attempted this at home with hand drills.\n- **Rotational Therapy**: Popularized by Erasmus Darwin (Charles' grandfather), patients were spun in a chair to \"reset\" the brain. Amateur versions involved homemade spinning devices.\n- **Hydrotherapy**: Extreme cold/hot water baths or prolonged wet-sheet wraps were used to \"calm\" patients. Families might improvise these with barrels or tubs.\n- **Insulin Shock Therapy**: Before clinical supervision was standard, some tried inducing comas with insulin injections to \"reset\" mental illness (often with deadly results).\n- **Mercury and Heavy Metals**: Swallowing mercury or arsenic was a folk remedy for syphilis (which caused psychiatric symptoms in late stages).\n\n---\n\n### **3. Non-Psychiatric DIY Experiments**\n- **Self-Surgery**: Exploratory surgeries (e.g., removing tumors or bullets) were sometimes attempted with kitchen knives and alcohol as anesthesia.\n- **Home Electroshock**: Early electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) devices were marketed to doctors for home use in the mid-20th century, with unpredictable results.\n- **Radium Quackery**: People ingested radium-laced tonics or applied radioactive pads to treat everything from arthritis to \"low vitality.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Why These Persisted**\n- **Lack of Alternatives**: Before antipsychotics (1950s+) or antibiotics, families resorted to extreme measures.\n- **Authority Figures**: Doctors like Freeman made dangerous procedures seem routine.\n- **Placebo Effect**: Some patients \"improved\" due to sedation or brain damage being mistaken for calmness.\n\n---\n\n### **Legacy**\nMany of these \"treatments\" were based on flawed theories (e.g., \"focal sepsis\" causing mental illness). Lobotomies fell out of favor after antipsychotics arrived, but their legacy is a cautionary tale about medical hubris. \n\nWould you like details on any specific procedure\u2019s tools or techniques? Some of these are grisly but technically ingenious in a macabre way."
